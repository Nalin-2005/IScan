# Developer Zone:
This project is based upon a customized version of NeutrinosPlatform's scanLibrary at https://github.com/NeutrinosPlatform/scanlibrary .
### Setting up native libraries:

Uncompress the jniLibs.7z from IScan/app/src/main/ using 7-Zip to IScan/app/src/main/jniLibs. Your directory structure should look something like this:
~~~shell
main\
    +- java
    |
    +- res
    |
    +- jniLibs\
    |         +- arm64-v8a\
    |         |           +-libopencv_java3.so
    |         |           +-libScanner.so
    |         +- armeabi\
    |         |         +-libopencv_java3.so
    |         |         +-libScanner.so
    |         +- ....
    |
    +- AndroidManifest.xml
~~~
